# Exploring LLMs

This repository documents my hands-on exploration of Large Language Models (LLMs).  
It serves as a sandbox for learning and experimenting with different techniques to better understand how LLMs work in practice.

### Purpose

The goal of this project is to:
- Make basic LLM API calls and study the inputs/outputs
- Experiment with different prompting techniques and configurations
- Compare execution behavior across methods (e.g., zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, function calling, etc.)
- Develop an intuition for practical use cases and limitations
- Small-scale experiments designed to isolate and observe specific LLM capabilities
- Emphasis on learning by doing, not production-ready code

### Notes

This is a learning-focused repo. The code and structure may evolve rapidly as I continue experimenting and gaining insights.

Stay tuned as I document my journey into the world of LLMs.
